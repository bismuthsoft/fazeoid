## What is This?

This is a synthesizer web application. It is designed to make it easy to design and visualize your own sounds.

It will eventually have MIDI input, and a way to share music and instruments with other users.

[Test it out here!](https://fmsite.netlify.app/)

## Running your own instance

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
